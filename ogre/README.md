conan recipes for Ogre.

## Travis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PamplemousseMR/conan-ogre.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PamplemousseMR/conan-ogre)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Generation

Generate using conan: `conan create . <USER>/<CHANNEL>`.
```
USER:
	This term in a Conan reference is basically a namespace to avoid collisions of libraries with the same
	name and version in the local cache and in the same remote. This field is usually populated with the
	authorâ€™s name of the package recipe (which could be different from the author of the library itself)
	or with the name of the organization creating it.

CHANNEL:
	Normally, package creators use `testing` when developing a recipe (e.g. it compiles only in few
	configurations) and `stable` when the recipe is ready enough to be used (e.g. it is built and tested
	in a wide range of configurations).
