# conan-libpng

conan recipes for libpng.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites for linux

- [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) : A massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression library.

### Generation

Generate using conan: `conan create . <USER>/<CHANNEL> [-o OPTIONS]`.
```
USER:
	This term in a Conan reference is basically a namespace to avoid collisions of libraries with the same
	name and version in the local cache and in the same remote. This field is usually populated with the
	authorâ€™s name of the package recipe (which could be different from the author of the library itself)
	or with the name of the organization creating it.

CHANNEL:
	Normally, package creators use `testing` when developing a recipe (e.g. it compiles only in few
	configurations) and `stable` when the recipe is ready enough to be used (e.g. it is built and tested
	in a wide range of configurations).

OPTIONS: 
	- libpng:shared={'True'|'False'}
		Set to 'True' to build shared library, default to 'False'.
	- libpng:fPIC={'True'|'False'}
		Set to 'True' to build position independent code, default to 'True'.
	- libpng:hardware_optimizations={'True'|'False'}
		Set to 'True' to build the library with hardware optimizations, default to 'True'.
```
